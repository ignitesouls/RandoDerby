## 🎯 Specific Rules of Rando Derby: The Crawl
1. Run Ends upon reaching Credits.
2. Upon completing a Dungeon, if the Dungeon has a warp inside the Boss Arena, the player can take it to reach the next dungeon.
3. If the Dungeon has no warp, the player will be warped to the next area. Most Major Bosses will follow this pattern.
4. Taking the first Grace in the next dungeon is recommended to avoid accidental soft locks.
5. Leaving the Dungeons in any way to reach the open world is not allowed.
6. The player has several Dungeon Abilities, including Weapon Upgrades, Ashes of War and the Dungeon Shop.
7. The Dungeon Shop is a special shop created for The Crawl containing some useful items.
8. Upgrade Stones are periodically unlocked in the Shop, usually when major bosses are killed.
